# Code style and comments

## Writing Code Like a Senior Engineer

Write every change as an experienced human engineer would — code a senior colleague
would approve without rewriting, indistinguishable from thoughtful hand-crafted work.
Optimize for the next person who reads it (usually your future self), not for looking
clever or finishing fast.

- **Clarity over cleverness** - clear beats clever every time. Expand a clever one-liner
  into a few obvious lines when it reads better. Readable code scales; clever code ages badly.
- **Write for the reader** - code is read far more than written. Make intent obvious on the
  page; don't make the reader hold state in their head or decode `u`, `s`, `tmp`.
- **Name things precisely** - intention-revealing names (`calculateTotalPrice`,
  `isSubscriptionActive`), never `d`, `x`, `foo`, or a bare `data`. A good name removes the
  need for a comment.
- **Small, single-purpose functions** - one job, one level of abstraction. If you're
  narrating "step 1… step 2…", split it into functions a reader can hold in their head.
- **Guard clauses over nesting** - return early and flatten arrow-shaped `if/else` pyramids;
  handle the edge/error case first, then the happy path.
- **No magic values** - lift magic numbers/strings into named constants or config; the name
  documents the intent.
- **Minimize side effects** - prefer functions that take input and return output; centralize
  state mutation and I/O rather than scattering it.
- **Reduce, don't just add** - seniors delete. Remove dead code, collapse duplication, prefer
  the smaller solution, and leave each file a little cleaner than you found it (boy-scout rule).
- **Match the surrounding code** - mirror the existing naming, structure, error-handling, and
  style of the file. Consistency beats personal preference.
- **Handle errors and edges deliberately** - no silent catches or ignored failures; make
  failure modes explicit and intentional.
- **Be pragmatic, not dogmatic** - these are defaults, not laws; knowing when to bend one for
  clarity or simplicity is what separates senior from junior.

Avoid the tells of machine-generated code: comments that restate the code, defensive
boilerplate nobody asked for, needless abstraction, over-verbose names, and style that drifts
within a file. The result should look like a thoughtful human wrote it.

## Clean code

The list above is the half of clean code that gets quoted: names, small functions, guard
clauses, no magic values, no duplication. What follows is the rest of it, and it is the half
that bites in review. The frame underneath both is that code is finished when it passes its
tests, holds no duplication, says what it means, and has no more parts than that.

**Signatures**

- **Few parameters** - none, one or two read at a glance; three is worth a second look and
  four wants a parameter object. A list long enough to count is usually two functions, or one type that
  hasn't been named yet.
- **No flag parameters** - a `bool` argument splits the body before the reader reaches it, and
  `foo(path, true)` says nothing at the call site. Ship the two functions the branches already
  are; where it genuinely is one operation, name the choice with an enum.
- **Meaning belongs in the type, not the primitive** - a bare boolean, integer or string at a
  boundary lets the wrong one through in silence. An enum or a wrapper type makes that a type
  error and retires the comment explaining the unit.
- **Command or query, never both** - a function either changes state or answers a question.
  One that does both leaves every call site working out whether calling it twice is safe.
- **Don't reach through** - `a.b().c().d()` couples the caller to the shape of everything in
  the middle. Ask the neighbour for the answer instead of walking its internals; the method
  you want usually belongs on the type you already hold.

**Reading order**

- **Newspaper order** - a file opens with what it is and descends into detail: caller above
  callee, related functions adjacent, blank lines separating concepts rather than decorating
  them.
- **Declare close to first use** - a binding introduced far above the line that reads it is
  state the reader has to carry until then.
- **Name the sub-expression** - lift a dense condition or a nested call into a local whose name
  is the explanation. That is the comment you never have to keep true.
- **Say it positively** - `if !not_ready` costs a mental flip at every read. Name the positive
  condition and negate at the one site that needs it.

**Vocabulary and shape**

- **One word per concept** - `get`, `fetch` and `load` for the same act, or two names for one
  thing, force the reader to check whether the difference means something. Rename it; never
  add the synonym.
- **A distinction that isn't in the name isn't a distinction** - `data`, `info`, `manager`,
  `helper` and a trailing `2` name nothing. If two things need telling apart, the names do it.
- **One home per boundary condition** - the cap, the clamp, the off-by-one. A named place that
  owns it beats the literal repeated at each call: tuning is one edit, reviewing is one read.
- **A dispatch repeated is a method missing** - the same `switch` or `match` spelled in three
  files wants to be one method on the enum, interface or trait. Adding a variant should break one file, not find three.

## Comments

Comments are a liability, not an asset — each one is prose you must keep true. Write few, make
each earn its place, and re-read every comment before moving on.

- **Explain *why*, not *what*** - the code already shows what it does; a comment justifies a
  non-obvious choice, trade-off, or gotcha. If you're narrating the code, delete it.
- **Prefer self-documenting code** - clear names and small functions beat comments. If a comment
  has to explain "step 1… step 2…", the function is too big — split it instead.
- **No redundant comments** - never restate a name, type, or the obvious (`// increment i` over
  `i++`; `// the user's name` over `userName`).
- **Be terse** - one line where one line works; no decorative banners, ASCII art, or boilerplate.
- **Sound like a senior engineer, not a generator** - write comments in plain, natural prose,
  the way a human colleague jots a note: terse, direct, peer-to-peer. Avoid the machine tells —
  restating the signature, "This function…", robotic step-by-step narration, hedging, and
  decorative filler. Assume the reader knows the language.
- **Double-check every comment** - confirm it is accurate and *still* true. When you touch code,
  update or delete the comments around it; a stale or wrong comment is worse than none.
- **Comment the genuinely non-obvious** - empty catch blocks, unsafe casts, workarounds (link the
  issue/PR), non-trivial regexes, magic constants, and concurrency/ordering assumptions.
- **No commented-out code** - delete it; version control remembers.
- **Match the file** - follow the surrounding code's existing comment *style*. Not its density:
  a dense neighbour is not a budget, and the rules above outrank it.
- **Document public APIs** using the doc-comment format below. Start with a single-sentence
  summary; don't just repeat the member name.
- **No changelog** - no "used to", "no longer" or "previously", no bug story, nothing about what
  shipped before. Git holds the history.
- **No second copy** - an argument lives at its anchor, the doc comment on what it constrains.
  Anywhere else names the anchor rather than arguing it again.
- **A module header is the module's contract and its one non-obvious why** - not its history,
  and not a tour of the functions below it.
- **One or two sentences carry a rationale** - a paragraph means a name, a type or a split should
  be saying it.
- **Don't overstate** - no "never", "always" or "forever" without the mechanism that makes it so;
  no benchmark figures, which go stale with the next change; a tunable's doc says what it does,
  not the value or rank it has today.
- **Some comments are kept whole** - an `oxlint-disable` line's reason, and a comment a rule or
  test points at, condensed with the pointer kept true.

**The budget is about 0.25 comment lines per line of code**, production code only:

```bash
# tests and build output left out
cloc --include-lang=TypeScript,CSS --exclude-dir=test,node_modules,dist,coverage,themes \
  --not-match-f='^jest\.config\.ts$' .
```

It holds across the corpus, not per file: a module of tuned constants can sit above it while a
plain one sits well below. It shows drift and is never an allowance; a comment the rules above
don't justify goes whatever the count says.

**Auditing a change.** After `npm run format` and `npm run lint` pass, and before the work is
reported done:

```bash
# every comment line the change adds; `main...` in place of `HEAD` for a whole branch
git diff -U0 HEAD -- '*.ts' '*.css' '*.html' | rg '^\+\s*(//|/\*|\*|<!--)'
# each file the change created, against the budget
cloc --by-file <new files>
```

- Each listed line passes the rules above or goes. A reworded or moved comment counts as new, so
  a rename that pushes a comment onto a second line gets rewritten back to one.
- The corpus command above confirms the tree-wide figure hasn't drifted.

**Doc comments in this tree:**

| Language | Doc syntax | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| TypeScript | `/** */` (TSDoc) | A module opens with a `@file` block. `@param name` takes no `{type}`, which the signature already carries; `@returns` only when the summary doesn't say it |
| CSS, HTML | `/* */`, `<!-- -->` | No doc form; the generic rules above are the whole contract |
